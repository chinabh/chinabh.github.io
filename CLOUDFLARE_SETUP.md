# Cloudflare Pages Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED: Use Cloudflare Workers Instead

**Best option:** Set up a Cloudflare Worker for form handling - no Chinese phone number needed, excellent China performance, and it's free.

**üìò See complete guide:** `claude/report/CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_SETUP.md` (15-30 minute setup)

**Why Workers > FormSubmit:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed to work in China
- ‚úÖ Free email via MailChannels
- ‚úÖ Full control over logic
- ‚ùå FormSubmit may be blocked in China

## Alternative: Using FormSubmit (Quick Testing Only)

### Option 1: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

**Step 1: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**
```
1. Log in to Cloudflare
2. Go to Workers & Pages
3. Select your "chinabhcn" project
4. Click "Settings" tab
5. Scroll to "Environment variables"
```

**Step 2: Add Environment Variables**

Click "Add variable" and add these two:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name: DEFAULT_RECEPTION_EMAIL
Value: contato@chinabusinesshub.com
Environment: Production
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name: FORM_SERVICE_TYPE
Value: formsubmit
Environment: Production
```

**Step 3: Trigger Rebuild**
```
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Click "Retry deployment"
```

**Done!** Form will now send to your email address.

### Option 2: Update JSON File Directly

If you prefer not to use environment variables:

**Step 1: Edit form-config.json**
```bash
# On your local machine
nano data/form-config.json

# Change line 7:
"action": "https://formsubmit.co/contato@chinabusinesshub.com"

# Save file
```

**Step 2: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add data/form-config.json
git commit -m "Configure form email address"
git push
```

**Done!** Cloudflare will auto-deploy.

## Testing Your Form

**After deployment:**

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit it
4. Check your email for:
   - FormSubmit confirmation email (first time only)
   - Click the activation link
5. Submit form again
6. Should receive the actual form submission

**Test from China (CRITICAL):**
- Use China VPN
- Or ask someone in China to test
- FormSubmit may be blocked
- If blocked ‚Üí Use Jinshuju instead (see FORM_SUBMISSION_02102025.md)

---

## Build Settings

**Already configured in Cloudflare Pages:**

Build command: `npm run build`
Build output directory: `dist`
Node version: 18 or 20

These should already be set from your initial setup.
