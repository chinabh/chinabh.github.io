## Test From China

**Critical:** You MUST test from China before announcing

### Method 1: Ask a Friend in China
Send them your URL and ask:
- Does it load fast? (should be <2 seconds)
- Do images load?
- Does form submit work?

### Method 2: Use China VPN
- Connect to China server
- Test your site
- Submit form

### Method 3: China Testing Services
- https://www.webkaka.com/webCheck.aspx
- Paste your URL
- Check loading speed from multiple China regions

## Troubleshooting

**Form not working?**
```bash
# Check if placeholder still there
grep "your-email@" data/form-config.json
```
If it shows text, you didn't update form-config.json!

**Images not loading?**
```bash
npm run build    # Rebuild
```

**Site slow?**
- Use Alibaba/Tencent Cloud (not Vercel/Netlify)
- Enable CDN in cloud console
